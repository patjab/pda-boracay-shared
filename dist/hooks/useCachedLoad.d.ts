/**
 * The cache-aware sibling of useGuardedLoad (admin#159): same signature shape
 * and the same GuardedState contract, plus the shared per-event cache — so a
 * screen hook swaps `useGuardedLoad(load, msg)` for
 * `useCachedLoad(key, load, msg)` and tab bounces stop being cold fetches.
 *
 * - `key` is the cache identity (key per eventId+resource, e.g.
 *   `${eventId}/guests`). A fresh hit renders instantly with no fetch; a
 *   stale hit renders instantly while a background refresh runs; a miss
 *   behaves exactly like useGuardedLoad.
 * - Changing `key` disposes the old handle, which ABORTS the old key's
 *   in-flight fetch — thread the provided AbortSignal into getJson/sendJson.
 * - `reload` invalidates the key and refetches — it reliably hits the
 *   network, never a cache no-op. (A write that affects OTHER keys still
 *   calls invalidateCache(prefix) itself.)
