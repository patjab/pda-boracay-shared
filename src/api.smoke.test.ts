/**
 * Live smoke tests — confirm every endpoint the UIs reference is actually a
 * reachable, wired API route. Run with `npm run test:smoke` (needs network).
 *
 * SAFETY — these CANNOT mutate data:
 *   They send ONLY HTTP `OPTIONS` (the CORS preflight). API Gateway answers
 *   preflight from its own CORS layer and NEVER invokes the backing Lambda, so
 *   no GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE handler runs — nothing is read or written,
 *   whatever the endpoint's real method is. The actual verb is never sent.
 *
 * Why OPTIONS is also the right "is this endpoint good?" probe:
 *   - real wired route   -> 2xx (200 on REST APIs, 204 on HTTP-API/custom domain)
 *   - dead / typo'd path -> 403 MissingAuthenticationToken
 *   - wrong host         -> DNS/TLS/connection failure (fetch rejects)
 *
 * Why it survives the custom-domain switch: it reads the URLs from ApiConstants
 * and asserts only "OPTIONS returns 2xx". After the hosts change to
 * api.pdaboracay.com it retargets automatically; it stays green iff the new
 * base-path mappings are wired correctly — which is exactly the safety net.

//  - EVENTS is a BASE, not a live route: consumers only ever use it to build
//    `${EVENTS}/{eventId}/config|/about` (which ARE live). The bare public
//    GET /events (list) was removed (cdk#352), so an OPTIONS probe of the base
//    itself returns 403 — expected, not a defect. The event-scoped forms it
//    builds are exercised by the pda-boracay-e2e api-coverage registry.
// The dead FLAT admin/guest/savethedate constants that used to fail here were
// deleted from ApiConstants outright (shared#57), so they are no longer probed.
// Every constant's shape is still covered by the hermetic contract test.
