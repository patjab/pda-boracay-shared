/**
 * Stage schema + prefill-source registry (cdk#962, cdk#976).
 *
 * This module is the TS source of truth for stage definitions: Valet (editor)
 * and Shore (guest app) import these types instead of declaring their own
 * mirrors. The Python validation in the stages Lambda remains the enforcement
 * boundary — shapes here mirror it, they don't replace it.
 *
 * A custom-stage question may declare `defaultFrom` — where its value starts
 * from on a fresh guest form. Sources are DATA, not code: the resolvers
 * (flattening functions with full access to the guest row) live server-side in
 * the stages Lambda; PREFILL_SOURCES is the {id, label} MENU the Valet picker
 * renders, so hosts choose from human labels and never type an identifier. The
 * Lambda validates a saved `defaultFrom` against these ids (bare un-namespaced
 * ids remain valid too — they name event-config keys, the original cdk#953
 * lane). Display blocks (cdk#976) resolve their `source` through the SAME
 * registry.
 *
 * Registry rules (decision log on cdk#962):
 *  - ids are namespaced (`rsvp.*`); flattenings must be SELF-CONTAINED —
 *    meaningful without the structure they came from (names yes; a bare
 *    allergies list never).
 *  - flattened values are SEEDS, not schemas: guests edit them freely and
 *    nothing downstream may parse them back.
 *  - stage-to-stage sources are deliberately absent (star, not chain) — adding
 *    one later is a registry entry, not a new mechanism.
